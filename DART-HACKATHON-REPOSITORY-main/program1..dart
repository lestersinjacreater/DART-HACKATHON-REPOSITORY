## Program 1: Display Personal Information
Write a Dart program using variables to display your name, age, school, and a hobby. Print it in one logical sentence.
void main() {
  // Define variables with a creative twist
  String name = "Lester Sinja (the programming Alchemist)";
  int age = timeSinceCreation(); // Function to calculate age, hidden for mystery
  String school = "Kirinyaga University";
  String hobby = "Writing them codes all day";

  // Print the sentence with a creative flair
  print("They call me $name, a seasoned scholar of $age epochs. I hail from $school, where knowledge flows freely. My true passion lies in $hobby, for in codes, I find the magic to empower, move and shake minds.");
}

// Function to calculate age (replace with your actual logic)
int timeSinceCreation() {
  // Replace with logic to calculate your age since creation
  return 23; // Placeholder for actual calculation
}
